* Functional Tests

Functional tests are automatd tests which unsure the application does
what it should from the point of the user.

We use [Nightmare](http://www.nightmarejs.org/) for our functional tests.

There's three functional tests, that match three different user login experiences:

* [First login user flow]()
* [Returning logged in user flow]()
* [Browsing user flow]()
