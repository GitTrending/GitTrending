* Unit Tests

Unit tests ensure that individual components work.
They are meant to be simple, fast, and generate good bug reports.

Each unit test identifies in the testing report:

* Component under test.
* Expected behavior for that component.
* Expected result.
* Actual result.

We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and
[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) (for assertions)
for our unit tests.

Our unit tests are divided into two categories:
the model, and the controller tests.

List of model components we are testing:
* []()

List of controller components we are testing:
* [HTML routes]()
